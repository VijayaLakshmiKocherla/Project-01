        fifteen consecutive
        multiple-choice questions. Each question is worth a specific amount of money
        and the money increases as the contestant moves to next question.

        will receive whatever money he/she had won up to that point. If the contestant answers all
        the questions correctly, then he wins a million.<br /><br />
        A 50-50 lifeline is available for a contestant to use if a question proves difficult.
        With this lifeline, Two incorrect answers are eliminated, leaving the contestant with a
        choice between the correct answer and one remaining incorrect answer.
